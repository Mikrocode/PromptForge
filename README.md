# PromptForge

PromptForge is a non-AI tool for people who work with AI prompts seriously.

It treats prompts as specifications, not chat messages.

PromptForge lets you:
- write prompts with enforced structure and clear constraints
- validate prompts for contradictions, ambiguity, and missing requirements
- lint prompts using strict, opinionated rules
- version prompts and inspect changes with clear diffs

The goal is simple: reduce vague prompts, prevent drift, and make prompt behavior predictable.

PromptForge does not generate content.
It does not suggest prompts.
It judges them.

Prompts in. Discipline out.
